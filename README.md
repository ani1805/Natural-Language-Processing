In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using Natural Language Processing

Libraries used:	
a. NLTK
b. PorterStemmer
c. Toktok Tokenizer
d. CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer
e. scikit-learn

The following is the description of the project:
•	Employed NLTK and Toktok Tokenizer to eliminate stop words and leveraged BeautifulSoup to strip HTML content from the dataset. Applied PorterStemmer to reduce words to their base form. 
•	Utilized and compared CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for tokenization. Observed a 2% accuracy boost on using TfidfVectorizer which shows its effectiveness.
•	Implemented Machine Learning algorithms to perform Sentiment Analysis on IMDB movie reviews. Identified Logistic Regression as superior with an 89% accuracy rate compared to Support Vector Machine. 
•	Demonstrated strong predictive capability of the model by using custom movie review texts. The model was able to predict the correct sentiment 9 out of 10 times.
